# Math 252 course materials.
This repo contains lecture notes, delivered at my course "Statistical Theory" at Claremont Graduate University from Sept. to Dec 2020. The course mostly contains standard topics in mathematical statistics such as point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and goodness of fit. Although the primary focus is on the theoretical aspects of mathematical statistics, various examples and exercises are also included and oriented toward applications. Students are expected to have taken introductory courses in probability theory and statistics. An advanced course in probability theory is helpful but not required. I used the lecture notes from Prof. John Angus and the book "Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics" by Bain and Engelhardt to prepare the course materials.
